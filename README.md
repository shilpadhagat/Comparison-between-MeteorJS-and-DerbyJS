# Comparison between Meteor JS and Derby JS

|`Features`|`Meteor JS`|`Derby JS`|
|------------------|-----------|-----------|
|`Databases`| Meteor supports MongoDB natively. Although future databse support is possible with FalthomDB and MySQL. Meteor supports Redis.io is also supported in beta. | Derby supports MongoDB and Redis. Derby comes packed with Racer, a data synchronization engine which makes data synching among database, server and browser. |
|`Server side rendering`| Meteor is more suited for building a web application than a website. Meteor ships all template, CSS and JavaScript code to the client, that takes a few seconds more for the first page to be rendered. For a web application, the initial loading time isn't that important. There are ways to speed up serving the first page, and optimizing the initial page load is still on the roadmap. Meteor also lacks in native server-side rendering which is useful useful for SEO. It would be interesting to see SSR natively integrated into the Meteor core in the future.| Derby comes with templating and server-side rendering. Server rendering is one such feature of Derby that allows fast page loads, search engine support and HTML templates to render in the browser or on the server. |
|`Front-End Stack`| Meteor uses three user interfaces libraries,React,Angular and it's own library Blaze. |   |
|`Underlying protocol`| Meteor uses Distributed Data Protocol (DDP) to communicate between the client and the server. It is a protocol based on JSON and maily helps in handling Remote procedure calls and managing the data.  |   |
|`Template`| Meteor's Blaze, a complete rewrite of Meteor's UI system comes along with Spacebars. Previously, Meteor used Handlebars templating language which is now replaced with Spacebars. The two share the same syntax, but Spacebars brings additional Meteor-specific time saving innovations. Some of them include dealing with HTML attributes, building custom block helpers, using JS objects as arguments etc. | Derby supports full JavaScript expression syntax. It's template syntax is loosely based on Handlebars. Theses templates encourages to separate logic from the presentation.During rendering, data that comes from the model are passed to the template and template expressions are replaced with appropriate values.With limited exceptions, Derby templates must adhere to HTML rules.   |
|`Latency Compensation`| Meteor comes with built-in latency compensation feature. The user actions ate instanly reflected and hence there is no need to wait for the server result. Latency compensation works only if you are doing write operations to a data store supported by Meteor (supports MongoDB and Redis). |    |
|`Browser Dependency`|     |    |
|`Performance Evaluation`|     |    |
