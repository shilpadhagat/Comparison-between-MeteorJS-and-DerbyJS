# Comparison between Meteor JS and Derby JS

|`Features`|`Meteor JS`|`Derby JS`|
|------------------|-----------|-----------|
|`Databases`| Both Meteor and Derby supports MongoDB by default. Meteor supports MongoDB and Redis (in beta) natively. Although future database support is possible with FalthomDB and MySQL. MongoDB does have its problems and there are community efforts to improve the support for other databases, or investigate new ones such as HyperDex, a faster and ACID-compliant alternative to MongoDB. | Derby supports MongoDB and Redis. Derby comes packed with Racer, a data synchronization engine which makes data synching among database, server and browser. |
|`Server side rendering`| Meteor does not have support for server-side rendering of views, which is extremely helpful when it comes to SEO. However, there's a third-party server-side rendering package available for download. Meteor is more suited for building a web application than a website. Meteor ships all template, CSS and JavaScript code to the client, that takes a few seconds more for the first page to be rendered. For a web application, the initial loading time isn't that important. There are ways to speed up serving the first page, and optimizing the initial page load is still on the roadmap. Meteor also lacks in native server-side rendering which is useful for SEO. It would be interesting to see SSR natively integrated into the Meteor core in the future.| Derby comes with templating and server-side rendering. Pages are initially rendered on server as HTML and then pushed to client rather than generating results on client. Additional changes are then handled on client. Server rendering is one such feature of Derby that allows fast page loads, search engine support (more SEO and mobile friendly ) and HTML templates to render in the browser or on the server. |
|`Front-End Stack`| Meteor uses three user interfaces libraries,React,Angular and it's own library Blaze. | Derby uses knockout/angular stylemodel property bindings.  |
|`Underlying protocol`| Meteor uses Distributed Data Protocol (DDP) to communicate between the client and the server. It is a protocol based on JSON and maily helps in handling Remote procedure calls and managing the data.Meteor has implemented both client and server implementations for DDP. There are a few client libraries for other frameworks and languages for connecting with Meteor via DDP. | In addition to route handlers of derby application we can add expressjs handlers implementing any RESTfull API. When derby application client router canâ€™t find the appropriate route, it sends request to the server to handle it. The next step is to connect browserchannel (an analogue of socket.io). It is a transport protocol which is responsible for synchronizing the application with the server in real time. At some point the client script browserchannel is added to bundle as well as handling requests from this module.   |
|`Template`| Meteor's Blaze, a complete rewrite of Meteor's UI system comes along with Spacebars. Previously, Meteor used Handlebars templating language which is now replaced with Spacebars. The two share the same syntax, but Spacebars brings additional Meteor-specific time saving innovations. Some of them include dealing with HTML attributes, building custom block helpers, using JS objects as arguments etc. | Derby supports full JavaScript expression syntax. It's template syntax is loosely based on Handlebars. Theses templates encourages to separate logic from the presentation.During rendering, data that comes from the model are passed to the template and template expressions are replaced with appropriate values.With limited exceptions, Derby templates must adhere to HTML rules.   |
|`Latency Compensation`| Meteor comes with built-in latency compensation feature. The user actions are instanly reflected and hence there is no need to wait for the server result. Latency compensation works only if you are doing write operations to a data store supported by Meteor (supports MongoDB and Redis). |  Derby too comes with latency-compensation feature. It's data manipulation layer Racer, is built on top of ShareJS, an operational transformation library enabling concurrent editing of documents with eventual consistency between multiple users. |
|`Package Management`| Custom meteor wrapper and can use most Node.js modules by going into the app/server directory and using npm. | Derby uses node.js' standard npm package manager. |
|`Performance Evaluation`| Meteor uses Kadira which is an excellent performance monitoring tool for Meteor apps. It profiles CPU and RAM consumption, subscription latency and throughput etc. Meteor way of implementing realtime is very simple, but it lacks of conflict resolution and have issues with performance. | Derby is more performant while scaling than Meteor. It is more secure than Meteor. |
|`More Thoughts`| Both Meteor and Derby has great potential. Both demonstarte what is possible for common language. Super simple for simple application. Official documentation is good. It has less generated boilerplate and more community love. | Derby has normal packages and building. Supports property level bindings and HTML in browser. Poor documentation with less core developer's support. Both requires to improve on security/scaling issues. |
|`Pros`| Meteor is Easy to learn and more popular than Derby. It has Isomorphic package system, which can supply code for both the client and the server, and for mobile (Cordova) apps. Also reload/refresh (hot code push). Integrated front-end library. Full stack reactivity. Provided seamless communication between client and server. It has real time testing framework. | In Derby, Views are rendered on the server, which means there is no delay in serving the content to the browser when the user requests it. Also helpful for SEO purposes. Provides real time communication between client and server. Derby is a full-stack JavaScript-everywhere platform thus can be run on both the server and the client. |
|`Cons`| No native SEO support. Requires reliance network connection. Officially supports only MongoDB, which is known to have issues with data integrity. | Derby at this moment has small community. The documentation is poor and hence becomes difiicult to easily build the application. |
